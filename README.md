# Advanced-Large-Language-Model-Agents-MOOC-Spring-2025
### Course Description
Large language model (LLM) agents have been an important frontier in AI, however, they still fall short critical skills, such as complex reasoning and planning, for solving hard problems and enabling end-to-end applications in real-world scenarios. Building on our previous course, this course dives deeper into advanced topics in LLM agents, focusing on reasoning, AI for mathematics, code generation, and program verification. We begin by introducing advanced inference and post-training techniques for building LLM agents that can search and plan. Then, we focus on two application domains: mathematics and programming. We study how LLMs can be used to prove mathematical theorems, as well as generate and reason about computer programs. Specifically, we will cover the following topics:

Inference-time techniques for reasoning
Post-training methods for reasoning
Search and planning
Agentic workflow, tool use, and functional calling
LLMs for code generation and verification
LLMs for mathematics: data curation, continual pretraining, and finetuning
LLM agents for theorem proving and autoformalization
