**Step 1:** Learn the basics of programming in Lean 4\. 
* Resource: [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/title.html). Read chapters [1](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/getting-to-know.html), [2](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/hello-world.html), [3](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/props-proofs-indexing.html), [9](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/tactics-induction-proofs.html). 

**Step 2:** Learn the basics of proof writing in Lean
* Resource: [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/tactics.html). Read chapters [1](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/introduction.html), [2](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_type_theory.html), [3](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/propositions_and_proofs.html), [5](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/tactics.html), [8](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/induction_and_recursion.html).

Additional Resources:
* All Tactics in Lean 4 \[[link](https://github.com/haruhisa-enomoto/mathlib4-all-tactics/blob/main/all-tactics.md)\]  
  * **Most Relevant Tactics:** rfl, rw \[h\], simp, intro/intros, exact, apply, cases, induction, exfalso, contradiction.  
* Lean 4, Natural Numbers Proof Game \[[link](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4/world/Addition/level/1)\]  
  * This is an interactive resource to learn the basics of proving, in the context of number theory.   
  * **Warning:** Not all examples are relevant. Look at the complexity of the test cases to get a better sense of the difficulty level we require (our test-suite is less challenging than what you may encounter online).
